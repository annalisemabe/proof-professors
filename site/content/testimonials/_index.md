  - quote: Ryan and Annalise were fantastic in helping me prepare for my post-grad
      job search. In preparation for interviews, they shared their 'best
      practices' and highlighted some of the questions one can expect. They were
      also encouraging and provided insight to how I could translate my skills
      and expertise in new settings. I think that's the most important part of
      the job search—advocating for yourself in a way that's genuine but also
      shows how your previous experiences can be used in a new position. With
      Ryan and Annalise's help, I was able to land a dream job that not only
      allows me to work in something I'm passionate about but also provides the
      perfect work-life balance.

    quote: Annalise and Ryan distill so many years of communications knowledge into
      accessible practices that have absolutely transformed my professional
      materials and public image. Because of their help, my work has become more
      visible and I’ve been able to land huge contracts and gain thousands of
      followers. I would recommend going to them before submitting for any job,
      or before launching your new product, website, or social media accounts.
      They are incredible!

    quote: I received the promotion! My dream job had unexpectedly opened up and I
      was gunning for it and needed a quick turnaround. Annalise helped me
      polish/format my resume (in hard science). Annalise also took the time to
      understand my current work dynamic so I could submit a powerful cover
      letter (humble, not cheesy, perfect). We were able to work together to
      formulate the right tone. I have recommended her to all my friends that
      are struggling to market themselves the way they deserve. Know your worth,
      hire Annalise, get the job.
  - quote: When Proof Professors worked with me on my personal statement, I
      appreciated the time they took in helping me absorb the meaning of each
      word I was using. They offered several words with similar meanings but
      different feelings and pushed me to think more about the connotation of a
      word. It was so valuable to get the perspective of a wordsmith in editing
      my writing. I would not hesitate to recommend them to my friends!

  - quote: I’m a medical professional, not a professional writer. I got into a top
      school because Annalise’s expertise helped me articulate my thoughts
      elegantly in my doctorate admissions essay. Furthermore, Annalise guided
      me in concisely explaining my qualifications for an international exchange
      program where I received a full scholarship to study abroad in Hong Kong.
      Annalise’s understanding of and passion for writing is truly life changing
      and I highly recommend her for any and all writing needs!

  - quote: Annalise has hands down exceeded my writing expectations. She has helped
      me with numerous essays, including the personal statement that got me
      accepted into Physician Assistant school. Working with her is always a
      pleasure. She is a brilliant writer and an overall kind-hearted person.
      She replies in a timely manner, gives amazing feedback and offers
      insightful suggestions to help strengthen your writing. I would highly
      recommend her services!
