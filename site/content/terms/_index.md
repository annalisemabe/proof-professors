title: Terms And Conditions
---
Thank you so much for choosing Proof Professors! We are excited to collaborate with you, and create job documents or essays showcasing you as an ideal candidate. 

The following are statements that you agree to when using our services:

**1.) A resume does not get me hired. A resume helps land a job interview.** 

A job interview precedes a job offer. Your job documents are just the beginning of your journey. You will also need to network and be proactive in your own job search strategies and job interview preparation.

**2.) We will not be writing your resume for you. We will collaborate with you on your resume.** 

You and your writing consultant will create and collaborate together to create a tailored resume. Both you and your writing consultant will put forth effort to meet deadlines and produce effective job application documents. That said, it is important to reply to all emails within a 48-hour period. 

**3.) You will be prepared for your consultation. I will make a good effort to show up to my phone consultation and will review my documents prior to the call.**

Consultations are the foundation to your success. You will make an effort to not only show up on time for your consultation, but you will also be prepared and have reviewed your documents and any other material prior to the consultation. The more information you can provide regarding your experiences and the job being applied for, the better we can assist.

**4.) Once you approve the job documents, you cannot request revisions.** 

Once you confirm receipt of your final drafts, this will show that you are satisfied and cannot request revisions free of charge.

Phone consultations are the time to modify and collaborate on your working drafts with your consultant. Once you receive your first drafts after your first phone consultation, you will have five business days to request additional revisions. 

If you do not request revisions during the five-day window after receiving your draft, we will send you the final drafts of the documents.

**5.) Proof Professors does not give out full refunds.** 

All sales are final. We value our consultants’ time and experience and want to make sure they are compensated for their hard work. 

**6.) You are the one responsible for the outcome of my job search, including any receipt of interviews or job offers.** 

Your consultant will work with you to create the most effective and tailored job documents for your chosen position, but you are the one solely responsible for sending out your job documents, preparing for your job interview, and ultimately the outcome of your job search.

By proceeding with services, you agree to the statements above, and you are ready to begin the resume or essay creation process.
